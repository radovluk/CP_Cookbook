    "Let the production consist of $N$ indivisible tasks performed on specified machines according to a process plan. Define the set of non-preemptive tasks $T=\\{0,\\dots,N+1\\}$ to be scheduled on a set of dedicated machines (renewable unary resources) indexed by $R=\\{1,\\dots,M\\}$. Each task $i\\in T$ has a processing time $PT_i$ and a machine assignment. Tasks $0$ and $N+1$ are dummy with $PT_0=PT_{N+1}=0$, where task $0$ is a predecessor and task $N+1$ is a successor of all other tasks. Precedence relations together with alternative process plans are specified via a Petri net (a directed bipartite graph with transitions and places). General temporal constraints (time lags) are given by a matrix $L=(\\ell_{ij})$ over $T^2$, where each $\\ell_{ij}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ enforces the inequality $s_i+\\ell_{ij}\\le s_j$, with $s_i$ the start time of task $i$. The earliest start time $ES_i$ is the minimum time at which task $i$ can be scheduled with respect to the temporal constraints alone (ignoring resources). We assume $\\ell_{ij}\\ge PT_i$ whenever transition $T_i$ is a direct predecessor of $T_j$ in the Petri net; all other $\\ell_{ij}$ values are arbitrary. If there is no temporal constraint from $i$ to $j$, set $\\ell_{ij}=-\\infty$. If task $i$ has a release time $r_i$ and a deadline $\\tilde d_i$, encode them as $\\ell_{0i}=r_i$ and $\\ell_{i0}=-\\tilde d_i$ (with $s_0=0$).\n",
    "Sequence-dependent setup times $o_{ij}$ represent additional time needed between tasks scheduled consecutively on the same machine. They satisfy the triangle inequality $o_{ij}+o_{jk}\\ge o_{ik}$ for all $(i,j,k)\\in T^3$. The optimality criterion is to minimize the schedule length (makespan) $C_{\\max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be classified as $PS_M,1,1\\mid alt,\\ temp,\\ o_{ij}\\mid C_{\\max}$ in the $\\alpha\\mid\\beta\\mid\\gamma$ notation, where $temp$ denotes generalized temporal constraints and $o_{ij}$ denotes setup times. Under the resource specification $PS_M,1,1$, there are $M$ machines with unary capacity, and each task requires at most one unit of a single machine. Since there are no additional resources, the problem can also be viewed as a machine-scheduling problem."
