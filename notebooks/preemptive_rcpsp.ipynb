    "First, you should add some constraints that says that each task represented by interval itvs[t] spans the set of individual activities a[<t,i>], something like: span(itvs[t], all(i in 1..t.pt) a[<t,i>])\n",

    "But note that for this preemptive version of the problem, you will loose one of the major interest of CP Optimizer which is the fact it avoids the enumeration of time. Here, if tasks are fully preemptive, you have to divide each task of duration D into D individual activities. If you know you have some constraints on the preemption of tasks (for instance that each individual activity has a minimal duration larger than the time unit), this can be exploited in the model to create less sub-activities.\n",
