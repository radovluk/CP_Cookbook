    "A. Stepwise Function (`CpoStepFunction`)\n",
    "* **Type:** Data Structure (Passive).\n",
    "* **Definition:** A function $f(t)$ that defines values over time.\n",
    "* **Role:** It acts as a **Map**. It describes the environment (e.g., \"The machine is broken from 10:00 to 12:00\").\n",
    "* **Effect:** On its own, it does **nothing** to the schedule. It just holds information.\n",

    "B. Forbid Extent (`forbid_extent`)\n",
    "* **Type:** Constraint (Active).\n",
    "* **Definition:** A rule applied to the model.\n",
    "* **Role:** It acts as the **Enforcer**. It looks at a Stepwise Function and applies a restriction.\n",
    "* **Effect:** It forces the solver to ensure a task **never overlaps** with any time segment where the Stepwise Function has a value of `0`.\n",
