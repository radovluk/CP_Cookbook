\section{Problem Definition}

\noindent A project is represented as a directed acyclic graph $G = (N, A)$ of non-preemptive activities with fixed durations and precedence constraints. A set of renewable resources with limited capacities constrains which activities can run simultaneously. RCPSP-AS extends the standard RCPSP by introducing alternative subgraphs, each with a principal activity $p_l$ whose immediate successors represent mutually exclusive branches---exactly one branch must be selected from each subgraph. The set of non-branching arcs is $A_{\text{prop}} = A \setminus \{(p_l, j) \in A : l \in L\}$. Activity $0$ is the source and activity $n$ is the sink.

\begin{align}
\min \quad & S_n + d_n \\[2mm]
\text{s.t.} \quad & x_0 = 1 \\
& x_i \leq x_j & \forall (i,j) \in A_{\text{prop}} \\
& \sum_{j:\, (p_l, j) \in A} x_j = x_{p_l} & \forall l \in L \\
& S_i + d_i \leq S_j + M(2 - x_i - x_j) & \forall (i,j) \in A \\
& \sum_{\substack{i \in N:\\ S_i \leq t < S_i + d_i}} r_{i,k} \cdot x_i \leq R_k & \forall k \in R,\; \forall t \in \mathcal{T} \\
& x_i \in \{0, 1\} & \forall i \in N
\end{align}

where $M$ is a sufficiently large constant and $\mathcal{T} = \{0, 1, \dots, T_{\max}\}$ is the planning horizon.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Minimize the makespan (completion time of the sink activity).
\item The source activity is always selected.
\item If activity $i$ is selected and $(i,j)$ is a non-branching arc, then $j$ must be selected.
\item Exactly one branch is selected from each alternative subgraph iff its principal activity is selected.
\item If both activities $i$ and $j$ are selected and $(i,j) \in A$, then $i$ must finish before $j$ starts.
\item The total resource demand at any time must not exceed capacity.
\item Decision variables: $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ (activity selection) and $S_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ (start times).
\end{enumerate}
