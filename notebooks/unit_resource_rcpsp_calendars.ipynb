    "This notebook demonstrates how to model and solve a Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with unit resources (workers/machines), resource calendars, and blocking time during breaks. The problem extends the classical RCPSP by incorporating:\n",
    "- **Unit resources**: Each resource is a single worker or machine (unit capacity)\n",
    "- **Resource calendars**: Resources have availability functions defining working periods and breaks\n",
    "- **Blocking time**: Resources remain blocked during their breaks if assigned to a task\n",
    "- **Multi-mode assignment**: Each task can be processed by any resource from its eligible set\n",
    "- **Non-preemptive processing**: Once a resource starts a task, it must complete it\n",

    "Consider a finite set of tasks indexed by $i \\in [1..N]$. We have a set of unit resources (workers/machines) indexed by $r \\in [1..R]$. Each resource $r$ has a defined availability function (calendar) $F_r(t) \\in \\{0,1\\}$ that specifies when the resource is working (1) and when it has a break (0), as described in model 3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each task $i$, there exists a set of eligible resources (modes) $M[i] \\subseteq [1..R]$. For every pair $(i,r)$ where $r \\in M[i]$, a net processing time $PT_{ir} > 0$ is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unit Blocking**: If task $i$ is assigned to resource $r$, this resource is blocked for the entire duration of the interval (including breaks given by the calendar), which corresponds to the NOOVERLAP condition from model 3.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-preemptive Assignment**: The task must be completed by the resource that started it. This is ensured by the structure of the interval variable $y_{ir}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calendars**: Work does not proceed during non-working time (e.g., weekends), but the interval remains active. This is modeled using the `intensity` or `forbidExtent` attribute.\n",

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "- **(1)** Minimize the makespan $C_{\\max} = \\max_{i\\in[1..N]} \\mathrm{endOf}(x_i)$ — the completion time of the last finishing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(2) Resource Selection (Alternative):** This constraint enforces that for each task $x_i$, exactly one resource $r$ from the set $M[i]$ will be selected. The interval $x_i$ is synchronized with the chosen $y_{ir}$. This ensures the requirement that \"one resource starts and the same one completes\" the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(3) Resource Blocking (NoOverlap):** This replaces the capacity constraints from traditional RCPSP formulations. Since we work with unit resources (individual workers/machines), we use a global `noOverlap` constraint on the set of all intervals assigned to resource $r$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This addresses the \"blocking time\" requirement. Even if a resource (e.g., worker Bob) has a break during the weekend (due to the `intensity` function), the interval $y_{ir}$ still exists and spans the weekend. The `noOverlap` constraint ensures that no other task can be inserted into this interval (not even during the weekend break).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{setup}}$ represents an optional matrix of setup times between task families.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(4) Precedence Relations:** Standard precedence constraints ensuring that task $i$ must complete before task $j$ can start for all $(i,j) \\in P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(5) Task Intervals:** Declares interval variables for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(6) Optional Resource Intervals:** Declares optional interval variables for each task-resource pair. Only the selected resource interval will be present in the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(9a) Net Processing Time (Size):** Defines that the task requires $PT_{ir}$ units of net working time when executed by resource $r$. This is the actual work content that must be completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **(9b) Resource Calendars (Intensity):** Applies the availability function $F_r$. When $F_r(t) = 0$ (e.g., weekend), work stops, the \"size\" does not decrease, and the interval extends in time (\"length\" increases) until the total \"size\" is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Modeling Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The combination of `intensity` and `noOverlap` ensures both calendar-aware scheduling and blocking during breaks.\n",
    "- The `alternative` constraint naturally handles the multi-mode aspect while ensuring non-preemptive assignment.\n",
    "- The model distinguishes between:\n",
    "  - **Size** (net work content): How much actual work needs to be done\n",
    "  - **Length** (calendar time): How much time the task spans, including breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "When a resource has a break (calendar value = 0), the interval continues to exist and blocks the resource, but no work progress is made (size doesn't decrease). Once the resource returns to work (calendar value = 1), work resumes until the full size is completed."

Both approaches achieve the same result: the task's \"size\" (net work) only decreases during working periods, and the interval automatically extends through breaks."
